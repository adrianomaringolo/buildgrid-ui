# buildgrid-ui

### This lib is under construction, take a look again soon ðŸš§

A React component library built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [shadcn](https://shadcn.dev) as the foundation. This library is designed to integrate seamlessly with React and Next.js applications and includes support for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It also provides a Storybook setup to display and document the components.

## Features

- **Built with Vite** for a fast development experience.
- **TailwindCSS Integration** for utility-first styling.
- **shadcn Components** as a robust base.
- **Storybook** for component documentation and testing.
- **Semantic Versioning** with automated releases using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
npm install buildgrid-ui
```

or

```bash
yarn add buildgrid-ui
```

### Usage

1. Import a component in your React project:

   ```jsx
   import { Button } from "buildgrid-ui";

   const App = () => <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>;

   export default App;
   ```

2. Ensure TailwindCSS is configured in your project. Add the following imports to your `styles.css` file (or equivalent):

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

3. Include the `tailwind.config.js` content paths for buildgrid-ui:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./node_modules/buildgrid-ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {

     },
     plugins: [],
   };
