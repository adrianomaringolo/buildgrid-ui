# buildgrid-ui

### This lib is under construction, take a look again soon ðŸš§

A React component library built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as the foundation. This library is designed to integrate seamlessly with React and Next.js applications and includes support for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It also provides a Storybook setup to display and document the components.

## Features

- **Built with Vite** for a fast development experience.
- **TailwindCSS Integration** for utility-first styling.
- **shadcn Components** as a robust base.
- **Storybook** for component documentation and testing.
- **Semantic Versioning** with automated releases using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
npm install buildgrid-ui
# or
yarn add buildgrid-ui
```

### Usage

1.  **Import Components**: Import components directly into your React project:

    ```jsx
    import { Button } from "buildgrid-ui";

    const App = () => <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>;

    export default App;
    ```

2.  **Import Theme Styles**: Import the library's theme styles. This should be done once in your application's entry point (e.g., `src/main.tsx`, `src/index.tsx`, or `pages/_app.tsx` for Next.js):

    ```javascript
    // For JavaScript/TypeScript files
    import 'buildgrid-ui/theme';
    ```

    If you are using a CSS file for global imports, you can add:

    ```css
    /* For CSS files */
    @import 'buildgrid-ui/theme';
    ```

3.  **Configure TailwindCSS (for v3)**: Ensure TailwindCSS is configured in your project. Add the following content paths to your `tailwind.config.js` to include `buildgrid-ui`'s classes:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
        "./node_modules/buildgrid-ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    };
    ```

    ```bash
    git checkout -b alpha
    git push origin alpha
    ```
2.  Pre-release versions (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1`) will be automatically created.
